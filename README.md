Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thank you for visiting! ‚≠ê

<h2 align="center">About Me </h2>
<p align="center">
I am a software developer based in France. I primarily work in TypeScript, Python or GDScript, though I am willing to learn other languages if needed. For the front end, I use React. For the back end, I use Node.js with MongoDB. Most of my projects tend to be Godot video games or Discord bots, as that is an area which I find engaging and challenging. And I am quite familiar with the Godot Engine and the Discord API. Aside from my dev work, I enjoy playing a game or watching an anime. Though I spend most of my time working as a developer. I am quite passionate about game design, creating and shaping the mechanics, systems, and rules of a game.

<h2 align="center">My Journey</h2>
<p align="center">
After 3 years of learning programming at Ecole 42 in Paris, and 2 internships of 6 months in Web development, I was able to use my knowledge to complete various missions in a first company. 
Today, after having taken the time to develop my projects related to video game development, I wish to resume programming within a solid structure with projects to deepen my skills and to be able to progress and evolve together.
